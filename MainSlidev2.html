              <p class="items t3">Basic Alchemy also details the creation of the Morphic Resonator and Essentia Filter, both crafting components used in many different recipes.</p>
              <p class="items t4">The Essentia Filter is a crafting component created at an Arcane Workbench with 2 gold ingots in any of the side right sections in a horizontal line with Silverwood planks in the center along with 15 Ordo and Aqua Vis.</p>
              <p class="items t5">Although the Essentia Filter has no inherent use of its own, it has many uses in Alchemy, being used in the creation of almost everything dealing with the movement and creation of Essentia.</p>

                  <p class="items c3">Before starting any infusion the player should always make sure that they have more than enough essentia to complete the infusion and spare prerequisite items should they be destroyed during the process. Easily mined blocks such as Dirt or Cobblestone should be kept on hand in the event Flux Goo manifests.</p>
                  <p class="items c4">Once ready, right-click on the Runic Matrix to begin the infusion. If the player is looking at the Runic Matrix while wearing the Goggles of Revealing or similar headwear, they will be able to see the amounts of essentia still required for the infusion.</p>

                  <p class="items l1">The "Thaumaturgy" page of the Thaumonomicon covers wands, and all their variations and accessories. Wands are constructed from a wand core and two wand caps. Later, they can be equipped with wand foci to expand their abilities. There are also many related devices, from Wand Recharge Pedestal to the Focus Pouch.</p>
                  <p class="items l2">A wand is the most basic magical tool of a thaumaturge -- indeed, the section of the Thaumonomicon dealing with wands and related magics, is simply titled "Thaumaturgy". Wands and their variations gather all normally begin with an iron-capped wooden wand. The only virtue of this crude tool is that it can be crafted on the vanilla crafting table, with no magical tools needed.</p>
                  <p class="items l3">This first wand is not only inefficient, but offers a risk of damaging the nodes upon which a thaumaturge depends for vis. At the first opportunity, a player should replace their wand with a gold-capped greatwood wand, and discard the iron/wood one. By this point, the player should also have mastered the "Node Preserver" ability, so that their own abilities will back up the potential of their tools.</p>

                  <p class="items r3">The Goggles of Revealing lack the ability to scan items, but in return can see Aura nodes from a greater distance, see magical information that would otherwise be hidden, even with a Thaumometer, and check the aspects in a node similarly to how one would with a Thaumometer.</p>
                  <p class="items r4">The Goggles of Revealing can be crafted at an Arcane Workbench with 4 leather in the top and middle left and right sections, 2 Brass in the top and bottom middle sections and 2 Thaumometers in the bottom left and right section, along with 25 of each type of Vis.</p>
